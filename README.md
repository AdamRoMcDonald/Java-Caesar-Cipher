# Java-Caesar-Cipher
Decrypt and Encrypt alphabetic messages using the Caesar cipher. The user inputs a message and a key which is used to do this. 

If you have a message but no key, you can still decrypt the message as well. 

To run in command prompt: 

cd C:/Users/(your username)/Downloads

javac Encryption.java Decrypt.java keyAndMessageObj.java Driver.java

java Driver

Then it will run.
